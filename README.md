Does this Python example look too simple, too normal for you?

`num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))`

`num3 = num1 + num2
print(num3)`

Well look no further! **Dear rustacean why.** is a over-complicated way of doing pretty much the same thing!

### Features
- Multithreading
- Parsing error handling
- Awful code!

### But, why?
My friend sent the wrong way of doing the said Python example above, with many, many ifs & elifs. <br />
So I decided, hey, why not do this in Rust? <br />
And that's where I went down the pipeline. <br />
